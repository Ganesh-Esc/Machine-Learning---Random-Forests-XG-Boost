Machine Learning -> Comparison of Random Forests & XG Boost

Random Forest and XGBoost are ensemble learning methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. I compared the performance (speed and accuracy) of these models for predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset.
